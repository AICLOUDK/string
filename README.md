In data structures, the term **"string"** refers to a sequence of characters used to represent text. It is a fundamental data type in many programming languages and is widely used to store and manipulate textual data.

### Meaning of String in Data Structures:
- **Definition:** A string is an ordered collection of characters, such as letters, digits, symbols, or spaces.
- **Representation:** It is typically enclosed within quotes (single `' '` or double `" "`), for example: `"Hello, World!"` or `'Data Structures'`.

### Usage in Data Structures:
- **Arrays or Lists:** Strings are often stored as arrays or lists of characters.
- **Linked Lists:** Strings can be represented as linked lists of characters for specialized applications.
- **Trie (Prefix Tree):** A tree data structure where strings are stored by sharing common prefixes, enabling efficient retrieval.
- **Hash Tables:** Strings are used as keys in hash maps or dictionaries for quick data retrieval.
- **String Manipulation:** Operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, searching, and pattern matching are common in data structures involving strings.

### Example:
```python
# String in Python
name = "Alice"
```

### Summary:
- **"String"** in data structures is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
- It's a fundamental building block for storing and manipulating textual data efficiently.
